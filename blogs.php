				<p class="blog-heading">Games On Game Pass – Deathloop</p>
				<p class="text">After spending a year as a timed Playstation exclusive, while being owned by Microsoft, Deathloop has finally arrived on the Xbox, giving a whole new group of people the chance to discover the genius of Arkane.

                    Let me kick off with a statement that’s likely to be a little controversial: </p>
				<p class="text">A reductive description, yes, but still fairly accurate. You awake back on the beach of a mysterious island at the end of every day with the goal of finding a way to kill the Visionaries who created this land trapped in an endless loop. To do that, you need to visit the four different locations, all of which change based on the time of day, and gradually discover how you can get your victims gathered together so they can be eliminated in one 24-hour period. h ’em up where you become intimately familiar with the locations and gradually build up a small armoury of powers and weapons. Every time you kill a target you get their special power and can improve it further by murdering the same target over and over. The more you play, the quicker and more effectively you can blitz through the levels, making you feel like a predator. Just four locations sounds like it shouldn’t be enough, yet Arkane’s talents at level design are more than a match for that issue. In many ways, it reminds me of playing through Hitman 3, where learning every nook and cranny is a fundamental part of the game. I also love the thematic idea of it all: at first, </p>

				<p class="blog-heading-1">Company of Heroes 3 Review</p>
				<p class="text">Heroes 3 is very good at times. It’s also in need of some work.

                    For this third entry, it seems Relic wanted to play it relatively safe, which is smart because nobody comes to a third game in a series looking for something radically different.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> In other words, if you’ve played either of the first two games you’ll be able to quickly grasp all the basics in Company of Heroes 3 in seconds. That might be disappointing to some, and that’s understandable. After so long without a new game in the series, there’s a natural expectation for Relic to make some big leaps forward and define what Company of Heroes will be going forward. But by being cautious and heavily pushing the idea that the game has been developed alongside the community, Relic clearly aimed to rebuild its faltering reputation by taking what they were known for a decade or more ago and doing it again. </span></p>

While I didn’t think much of Nebuchadnezzar when it launched,<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">the Steam reviews tell a tale of a developer that has worked long and hard to improve the game, introducing loads of new features and ironing a lot of the issues I had with the game. So now we get to see the old Mummy return with fresh bandages and duke it out against its own descendent. Cool.

				<p class="blog-heading-1">Pronty (Switch) Review </p>
				<p class="text">You are Pronty. Well, you’re actually a clone of a Pronty, a sort of genetically engineered life form meant to protect the underwater city of Royla from threats by stabbing said threats with Bronty,<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> a robot swordfish that is directly linked to Pronty’s mind. Believe me, I’m aware of how insane this sounds but I tell you nothing but the truth. Royla is clearly the remains of what was once presumably our own Earth, humanity little more than a distant memory. Perhaps not even that. Vast statues, reactors and more are all now just part of the underwater landscape.</span></p>
